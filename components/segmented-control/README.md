# Segmented Control

> A visual pattern for presenting related choices, navigation destinations, filters, or content views.

## About

A segmented control is a visual pattern, not a standalone behavior. COSS uses the same presentation across several components while preserving the semantics, keyboard interactions, and state model of each underlying primitive.

## Choose the right primitive

| Intent | Use | Why |
| ------ | --- | --- |
| Choose one value in a form | [Radio Group](/ui/docs/components/radio-group) | Represents a mutually exclusive value and participates in form state. |
| Navigate to another URL or route | Navigation links | Preserves link behavior, browser history, and `aria-current`. |
| Apply an exclusive filter or mode | [Toggle Group](/ui/docs/components/toggle-group) | Represents the pressed state of an action that may be cleared. |
| Switch between related panels | [Tabs](/ui/docs/components/tabs) | Connects each tab to an associated content panel. |

Choose the primitive from the interaction first, then apply the segmented-control styling. Visual similarity alone is not a reason to use Tabs or Toggle Group.

## Installation

Segmented controls are provided as particles. Install the implementation and size that match your interaction:

| Implementation | Small | Default | Large |
| -------------- | ----- | ------- | ----- |
| Radio Group | `@coss/p-radio-group-7` | `@coss/p-radio-group-8` | `@coss/p-radio-group-9` |
| Navigation | `@coss/p-navigation-2` | `@coss/p-navigation-1` | `@coss/p-navigation-3` |

For example, install the default Radio Group version with:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @coss/p-radio-group-8
```

The CLI installs the shared `segmented-control` styling library and the required primitive automatically.

## Shared styling

For a custom composition, install the styling library directly:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @coss/segmented-control
```

The library exports a root class, an item recipe, and a shared item layout class for icons:

```tsx
import {
  segmentedControlItemLayoutClassName,
  segmentedControlItemVariants,
  segmentedControlRootClassName,
} from "@/lib/segmented-control"
```

```tsx
const itemClassName = segmentedControlItemVariants({
  size: "default",
  state: "checked",
})
```

| Option | Values | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ----------- |
| `size` | `"sm" \| "default" \| "lg"` | Controls item height and horizontal padding. |
| `state` | `"checked" \| "current" \| "pressed"` | Selects the state attribute used by the underlying element. |

Use `checked` with Radio Group, `current` with navigation links, and `pressed` with Toggle Group. Tabs retain their own animated indicator and do not use the shared state recipe. They reuse `segmentedControlItemLayoutClassName` so icons match the other segmented implementations.

At the outside edges, the item padding and the surface's `p-0.5` inset combine to match the horizontal padding of the corresponding Button size. The outer segmented surface is slightly taller than that Button to optically balance its inset selected item when the controls appear next to each other.

## Radio options

Use Radio Group when the selected segment represents a mutually exclusive value, especially in forms.

### Small Radio Group

<ComponentPreview name="p-radio-group-7" />

### Default Radio Group

<ComponentPreview name="p-radio-group-8" />

### Large Radio Group

<ComponentPreview name="p-radio-group-9" />

## Navigation

Use links when each segment points to a different destination. Apply `aria-current="page"` to the active link.

### Small Navigation

<ComponentPreview name="p-navigation-2" />

### Default Navigation

<ComponentPreview name="p-navigation-1" />

### Large Navigation

<ComponentPreview name="p-navigation-3" />

## Related content

Use Tabs when each segment controls an associated content panel. Tabs share the visual language of segmented controls but keep their animated indicator, orientation support, and panel semantics.
